 This bot is a kind of Complaining Twitter Bot.
 Just like A_Comcast_User in Twitter

 Depending on who your internet provider is and how much you're paying,
 They tend to guarantee a minimum internet speed
 Almost we all are not getting the promised internet speeds.

 So, for us this CT Bot would do a speed test and then send its internet speeds by Twitter to Comcast to complain.
